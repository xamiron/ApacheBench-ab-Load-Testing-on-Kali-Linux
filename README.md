##  Overview

**ApacheBench (ab)** is a lightweight, command-line HTTP benchmarking tool that comes bundled with the `apache2-utils` package. It's perfect for measuring performance metrics such as Requests Per Second (RPS), response times, throughput, and error rates.

>  **Tip:** ApacheBench is great for single-host testing and early-stage performance validation. For distributed or high-scale load tests, consider using `k6`, `wrk2`, or `Gatling`.



##  Requirements

| Component            | Details                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **OS**               | Kali Linux 2024.3                                |
| **Tool**             | apache2-utils (includes `ab`)                    |
| **Processor**        | Intel Core i7 or higher                          |
| **Memory**           | 16 GB RAM (recommended)                          |
| **Network**          | 100 Mbps Broadband                               |
| **Monitoring Tools** | `top`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, `ss`, and server logs |


##  Installation

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2-utils -y
```

Verify installation:

```bash
ab -V
```

---

##  Basic Commands

Run a quick test with 100 requests and 10 concurrent users:

```bash
ab -n 100 -c 10 https://www.example.com/
```

Save the result to a text file for later analysis:

```bash
ab -n 10000 -c 1000 https://www.example.com/ > ab_report.txt
```

**Common Parameters:**

| Flag | Description                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `-n` | Total number of requests                 |
| `-c` | Number of concurrent users               |
| `-t` | Duration of the test (in seconds)        |
| `-H` | Add custom headers (e.g., Authorization) |
| `-p` | Send POST data from file                 |

##  Test Types & Examples

###  1. Smoke Test — Connectivity & Baseline

```bash
ab -n 100 -c 5 https://www.example.com/
```

Purpose: Verify basic server connectivity and baseline performance.

---

###  2. Progressive Ramp-Up Test — Scaling Behavior

```bash
ab -n 5000 -c 50 https://www.example.com/
ab -n 5000 -c 100 https://www.example.com/
ab -n 5000 -c 200 https://www.example.com/
ab -n 10000 -c 1000 https://www.example.com/
```

Purpose: Identify the point where latency or error rate increases significantly.

---

###  3. Soak Test — Long-Term Stability

```bash
ab -c 200 -t 1800 https://www.example.com/
```

Run for 30–60 minutes to detect memory leaks or slow degradation.

---

###  4. Spike Test — Sudden Surge Handling

```bash
# Gradual baseline
a b -n 10000 -c 100 https://www.example.com/
# Sudden spike
ab -n 10000 -c 1000 https://www.example.com/
```

Simulates flash traffic or sudden spikes to test resilience.

---

##  Monitoring During Tests

**On Kali (Client):**

```bash
top           # Monitor CPU & Memory
vmstat 1      # System stats
 iostat -x 1  # Disk I/O
ss -s         # Network connections
```

**On Server (Target):**

* Check `access.log` and `error.log`
* Monitor CPU, RAM, I/O, and network
* Track reverse proxy or DB metrics

---

## Interpreting Key Metrics

| Metric                        | Description                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Requests per second (RPS)** | Throughput performance              |
| **Time per request (mean)**   | Average latency per request         |
| **Failed requests**           | Error or dropped connections        |
| **Transfer rate**             | Throughput in KB/sec                |
| **Connection times**          | Connect, Processing, Waiting, Total |

> ⚠️ **Watch out:** A rising number of failed requests at high concurrency indicates bottlenecks like database locks, thread limits, or CPU starvation.

##  Best Practices & Safety

✅ Always test on staging or pre-production
✅ Monitor both client & server metrics
✅ Stop the test immediately if resources max out
✅ Avoid testing third-party endpoints
✅ For heavier loads, distribute across multiple clients
